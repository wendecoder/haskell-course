# Haskell Course

**This course is designed to teach students Haskell from zero to everything needed to work with Marlowe and Plutus.** The course itself doesn't contain content specific to Marlowe or Plutus. So, if you want to use it to learn Haskell for other purposes, you can! 😃

For a more detailed explanation, keep reading or watch the introduction video:
[![YouTube](https://img.shields.io/badge/YouTube-%23FF0000.svg?style=flat&logo=YouTube&logoColor=white)](https://youtu.be/H1vbUKMKvnM)

## How much should I study if I only wish to use Marlowe/Plutus?

In the [outline](#what-well-cover) below, there are clear stopping points (for both Marlowe and Plutus) where we deem you to know enough Haskell to effectively use the technology.

## How to read/watch the lessons

To go through the interactive lessons, go to your chosen lesson's outline inside "[What we'll cover](#what-well-cover)" and click on the button that looks like the one below. If the page loads with a "500: Internal Server Error" just refresh it, and it should be fine. At the top, you will see a console that displays the progress of preparing your interactive lesson. During this time, you can scroll down and look at the lesson, that is displayed non-interactively.

## To do the homework

1. Clone this repository.
2. Create a [GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io/) account.
3. Click this button to create a remote dev environment: [![Visual Studio Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Visual%20Studio%20Code-0078d7.svg?style=flat&logo=visual-studio-code&logoColor=white)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/input-output-hk/haskell-course)
